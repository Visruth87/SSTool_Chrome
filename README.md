https://www.python.org
Stack Overflow|https://stackoverflow.com
```

GitHub,https://github.com
Python,https://www.python.org
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:
- Screenshot timing and retry settings
- Chrome browser options
- DOCX document formatting
- GUI appearance
- File paths and directories

## Sample Files

The application can generate sample input files:

```python
from url_processor import URLProcessor

processor = URLProcessor()

# Create sample TXT file
processor.create_sample_txt_file("sample_urls.txt")

# Create sample CSV file
processor.create_sample_csv_file("sample_urls.csv")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Chrome Driver Issues
- **Automatic Download**: The application automatically downloads Chrome driver
- **Network Issues**: If download fails due to network/firewall, download manually
- **Manual Installation**: Download from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
- **Version Mismatch**: Ensure Chrome browser and driver versions are compatible

### Screenshot Issues
- Make sure Chrome window is not minimized during capture
- Some websites may block automated browsers
- Increase wait time in config.py for slow-loading sites

### Permission Issues
- Run as administrator if you get permission errors
- Ensure the output directory is writable

### Memory Issues
- For many URLs, process them in smaller batches
- Close other applications to free up memory
- Reduce image quality in config.py if needed
